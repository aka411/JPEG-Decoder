# JPEG-Decoder

This is one of my earlier projects that i wrote.It was written without using any libraries.Instead i wrote my own parser and decompresser for this.I wrote this just for learning.Since it is one of my earlier works it is not well structured and organised and currently it does not work for every type of png and it can only decompress and extract the luminance data(Jpeg before compression converts RGB to YCbCr color space hence decompressed data will be in YCbCr color space).
